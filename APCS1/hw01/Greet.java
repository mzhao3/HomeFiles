/* 
Like Python and Scheme, indents are used to clarify the function being defined and/or to tell the program what is in the function. However, unlike Python, the parentheses and braces are necessary to make the code work. Java, like Python, uses semi-colons, although in Python they are only used to define functions or after conditionals. Java is much more wordy and complicated than Scheme and Python, which really only require the print command. However, the main portion of the code (the print statement) is very clear in all of them (probably because it's the only line with a string).
